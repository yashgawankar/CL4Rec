# Overcoming Forgetting in Adaptive Recommender Systems: A Comparative Study
Applying continual learning techniques to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in sequential recommendation systems 

### Dataset 
- Download MovieLens 100K dataset from [here](https://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-100k.zip). 

### Performing Continual Learning Experiments 
- Open cl_experiments.py in Colab 
- Upload the downloaded MovieLens dataset (ml-100k.zip) to Colab 
- Upload main_test.py to Colab
- Run the cells in the notebook to preprocess the data, create the training periods, set up the environment, and run the different continual learning methods.
